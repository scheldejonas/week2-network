# Week 2: Networking
For the networking part we will explore the entire network stack from the bits in your computer to routers sending IP packages, orchestrated by huge internet exchange points, to finally run through undersea cables across the globe. This part will give you an understanding of how networks work and how you can use this when developing web services.

This part also covers HTTP and HTTPS (the standard protocols you use to navigate the internet), and some basic security measures to keep your services and data safe.

This repository contains the presentation used in the lectures and the exercises we will
be working on throughout the week. Please feel free to participate with improvements by
submitting [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Good
pull requests will be given studypoints and praise!

## Exercises
There are a set of exercises for each day. They are designed to cover the material
for that day and help you towards the Friday exercises at the end of the week. Please
note that the exercises _will_ build on previous material. So _please_ at least have
a look at them every day and make sure you feel comfortable with them. If you do not
we guarantee you it will be harder to catch up later in the semester.

## Nginx guide
I wrote a more thorough guide to Nginx where I've collected some of the resources we
covered throughout the weeks. If you need another look at the Nginx system, I hope
this will help you understand it better:

## How to learn
This repository is made to help you so we hope you can use the resources we give you.
It is tremendously important, that you think about how you like to learn.

Do you like to learn as you go? Then work with the exercises.

Do you like to learn by reading? Then fetch the presentations and look at the course
materials.

Do you like to learn by listening or seeing? Then come to the school and participate
in the classes.

Or, if you're smart, do all of the above. 
[Research shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_theory_(education)#Multimedia_learning)
that you learn better when you do different things.

## Getting in touch
We are happy to answer questions you might have, but we are also encouraging you
to try and find the solutions yourselves; that is often the most fun! But never
hesitate to discuss your questions with a teacher. If you cannot make it in person,
you can get in touch with me at jeep@cphbusiness.dk.
