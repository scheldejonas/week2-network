/**
 * <h2>Task 1</h2>
 * <p>
 *     Your first task is to write an UDP server instead of a TCP server. UDP splits your data into small data fragments
 *     and sends them off without any guarantee of order: you don't know which package comes first! (A bit like
 *     concurrency). Instead of the constantly open output- and input-streams from the TCP server, you receive and
 *     send things from/to byte arrays.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     So, each package receives a certain amount of bytes. In our (kinda artificial) case we only receive 10 bytes.
 *     Use the {@link #DATA_BUFFER} for storing and retrieving data in this exercise.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Your job is to implement a UDP server that binds to a socket on your local machine and waits until a client
 *     sends some data. When the data arrives you print it out. That's it! When it's printed, notice how much data is
 *     sent (and how much isn't). That's the drawback of this approach. On the other hand it's fast!
 * </p>
